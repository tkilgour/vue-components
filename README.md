# vue-components

This is central repo of individual Vue components I have made. They should be as portable as possible and have the following characteristics:

- definable content (slots)
- functionality can be integrated (through props and emitted events)
- limited styling (unless component is meant to be overtly styled)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
